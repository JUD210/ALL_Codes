In our if statement template, notice that statement is singular, not plural:

if ( expression ) statement

What if we want an if statement to control two or more statements? That's where the compound statement comes in. A compound statement has the form

{ statements }

By putting braces around a group of statements, we can force the compiler to treat it as a single statement.

Here's an example of a compound statement:

{ line_num = O; page_num++; }

For clarity, I'll usually put a compound statement on several lines, with one statement per line:

{
  line_num = 0;
  page_num++;
}

Notice that each inner statement still ends with a semicolon, but the compound
statement itself does not.

Here's what a compound statement would look like when used inside an if
statement:

if (line_num == MAX_LINES) {
  line_num = O;
  page_num++;
}

Compound statements are also common in loops and other places where the syntax
of C requires a single statement, but we want more than one.

=== Logical Expressions
ㅇ Several of C's statements, including the if statement, must test the value of an expression to see if it is "true" or "false".

ㅇ For example, an if statement might need to test the expression i < j; a true value would indicate that i is less than j.

ㅇ In many programming languages, an expression such as i < j would have a special "Boolean" or "logical" type, Such a type would have only two values, false and true.

ㅇ In C, however, a comparison such as i < j yields an integer: either 0 (false)
or 1 (true).

ㅇ With this in mind, let's look at the operators that are used to build logical expressions.


ㅇ Relational Operators
expr1 < expr2
expr1 > expr2
expr1 <= expr2
expr1 >= expr2

ㅇ Equality Operators
expr1 == expr2
expr1 != expr2

ㅇ Logical Operators
!expr
expr1 && expr2
expr1 || expr2

/* The following "prime-testing" loop appeared in Section 6.4 as an example:

for (d = 2; d < n; d++)
  if (n % d == 0)
    goto done;
done:
if (d < n)
  printf("%d is not prime because it is divisible by %d\n", n, d);
else
  printf("%d is prime\n", n);


This loop isn't very effâ€Œicient. it's not necessary to divide n by all numbers between 2 and n - 1 to determine whether it's prime. In fact, we need only check divisors up to the square root of n.

Modify the loop to take advantage of this fact.

Hint: Don't try to compute the square root of 11; instead, compare d * d with n. */

=== The do Statement
ㅇ do  statement  while  ( expression ) ;

i=1O;

do {
  printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
  --i;
} while (i > 0);


ㅇ When a do statement is executed, the loop body is executed first, then the controlling expression is evaluated.

ㅇ If the value of the expression is nonzero, the loop body is executed again and then the expression is evaluated once more.

ㅇ Execution of the do statement terminates when the controlling expression has the value 0 after the loop body has been executed.

Q: Are there any other ways to make an empty loop body stand out besides putting the null statement on a line by itself? [p. 117]

A:
Besides putting the null statement on a line by itself:
for (d = 2; d < n && n % d != O; d++)
  ;

Some programmers use a dummy continue statement:
for (d = 2; d < n && n % d != O; d++)
  continue;

Others use an empty compound statement:
for (d = 2; d < n && n % d != 0; d++)
  {}

=== Infinite Loops
ㅇ A while statement won't terminate if the controlling expression always has a nonzero value. In fact, C programmers sometimes deliberately create an inf inite loop by using a nonzero constant as the controlling expression:

while (1) ...


ㅇ A while statement of this form will execute forever unless its body contains a statement that transfers control out of the loop (break, goto, return) or calls a function that causes the program to terminate.

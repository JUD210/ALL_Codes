=== The while Statement
ã…‡ while ( expression ) statement
The expression inside the parentheses is the controlling expression; the statement after the parentheses is the loop body.

Here's an example:
while (i < n) /* controlling expression */
  i = i * 2;  /* loop body */

Note that the parentheses are mandatory and that nothing goes between the right parenthesis and the loop body. (Some languages require the word do.)

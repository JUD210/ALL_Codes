The break, continue, and goto statements cause an unconditional jump to some other place in the program. (The return statement belongs in this category, as well.)


break;
- break transfers control just past the end of a loop.
- can be used in switch statments and loops (while, do, and for)


continue;
- continue transfers control to a point just before the end of the loop body.
- can be used only in loops


goto;

identifier: statement
goto identifier;
- goto L transfers control to the statement that follows the label L, which must be in the same function as the goto statement itself.
- in C99, can't be used to bypass the declaration of a variable-length array.

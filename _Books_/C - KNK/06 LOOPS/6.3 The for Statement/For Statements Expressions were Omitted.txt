The for statement is even more flexible than we've seen so far. Some for loops
may not need all three of the expressions that normally control the loop. so C
allows us to omit any or all of the expressions.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...  // initialize, test, update
for (     ; i < 10; i++) ...  // no initialization
for (     ;       ;    ) ...  // infinite loop. (== while (1) ...)

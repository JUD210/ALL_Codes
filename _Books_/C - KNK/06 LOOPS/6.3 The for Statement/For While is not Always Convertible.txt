Q: Section 6.3 says that, except in rare cases, for loops can be converted to while loops using a standard pattern. Can you give an example of such a case? [p. 106]

A: When the body of a for loop contains a continue statement, the while pattern shown in Section 6.3 is no longer valid. Consider the following example from Section 6.4:

sum = 0;
n = 0;
while (n < 10) {
  scanf("%d", &i);
  if (i == 0)
    continue;
  sum += i;
  n++;
}

At first glance, it looks as though we could convert the while loop into a for
loop:

sum = O;
for (n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
  scanf("%d", &i);
  if (i == 0)
    continue;
  sum += i;
}

Unfortunately, this loop isn't equivalent to the original. When i is equal to O, the original loop doesn't increment n, but the new loop does.

=== for Statement Idioms
ㅇ Counting up from 0 to n-1:
  for (i = O; i < n; i++) m

ㅇ Counting up from 1 to n:
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) m

ㅇ Counting down from n-1 to 0:
  for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) m

ㅇ Counting down from n to 1:
  for (i = n; i > O; i--) m


ㅇ Imitating these patterns will help you avoid some of the following errors,
which beginning C programmers often make:

- Using < instead of > (or vice versa) in the controlling expression. Notice that "counting up" loops use the < or <= operator, while "counting down" loops rely on > or >=.

- Using == in the controlling expression instead of <, <=, >, or >=. A controlling expression needs to be true at the beginning of the loop, then later become false so that the loop can terminate. A test such as i == n doesn't make much sense, because it won't be true initially.

- "Off-by-one" errors such as writing the controlling expression as i <= n
instead of i < n.

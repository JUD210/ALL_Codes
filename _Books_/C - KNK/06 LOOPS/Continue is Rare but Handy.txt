Q: I've heard that programmers should never use the continue statement. Is
this true?

A: It's true that continue statements are rare. Still, continue is handy once in a while. Suppose we're writing a loop that reads some input data, checks that it's valid. and, if so, processes the input in some way. If there are a number of validity tests, or if they're complex, continue can be helpful. The loop would look something like this:

for (;;) {
  read data;
  if (data fails first test)
    continue;
  if (data fails second test)
    continue;
  ...
  if (data fails last test)
    continue;
  process data;
}

Q: What's so bad about the goto statement? [p. 114]

A: The goto statement isn't inherently evil; it's just that we usually have better alternatives. Programs that use more than a few goto statements can quickly degenerate into "spaghetti code", with control blithely jumping from here to there. Spaghetti code is hard to understand and hard to modify.

goto statements make programs hard to read because they can jump either forward or backward. (In contrast, break and continue only jump forward.) A program that contains goto statements often requires the reader to jump back and forth in an attempt to follow the fâ€Œlow of control.

goto statements can make programs hard to modify, since they make it possible for a section of code to serve more than one purpose. For example, a statement that is preceded by a label might be reachable either by "falling through" from the previous statement or by executing one of several goto statements.

=== The goto Statement
ㅇ The goto statement is capable of jumping to any statement in a function, provided that the statement has a label.

ㅇ C99 places an additional restriction on the goto statement: it can't be used to bypass the declaration of a variable-length array.

ㅇ A label is just an identifier placed at the beginning of a statement:

identifier : statement

A statement may have more than one label. The goto statement itself has the form:

goto identifier ;


ㅇ Executing the statement goto L; transfers control to the statement that follows the label L, which must be in the same function as the goto statement itself.

ㅇ If C didn't have a break statement, here's how we might use a goto statement to exit prematurely from a loop:

for (d = 2; d < n; d++)
  if (n % (1 == 0)
    goto done;

done:
if (d < n)
  printf("%d is divisible by %d\n", n, d);
else
  printf("%d is prime\n", n);

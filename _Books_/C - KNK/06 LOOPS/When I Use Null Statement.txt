Q: Does the null statement have any uses besides indicating that the body of a
loop is empty? [p. 116]

A: Very few. Since the null statement can appear wherever a Statement is allowed, there are many potential uses for the null statement. In practice, however, there's only one other use of the null statement, and it's rare.

Suppose that we need to put a label at the end of a compound statement. A label can't stand alone: it must always be followed by a statement. Putting a null statement after the label solves the problem:

{
  ...
  goto end_of_stmt;
  ...
  end_of_stmt: ;
}

=== Effective Use of C
ㅇ Learn how to avoid C pitfalls.
- Modern compilers will detect common pitfalls and issue warnings, but no compiler spots them all.

ㅇ Use software tools to make programs more reliable.
- lint
- debugger

ㅇ Take advantage of existing code libraries.
- common tasks
- user-interface development
- graphics
- communications
- database management
- networking
- public domain, open source, ...

ㅇ Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions.
- Which set you use is less important than adopting some conventions and sticking to them.

ㅇ Avoid "tricks" and overly complex code.
- Programmers are often tempted to choose the method that's most concise. Don't get carried away; the shortest solution is often the hardest to comprehend.

ㅇ Stick to the standard.
- C89, C99
- For portability, it's best to avoid using nonstandard features and libraries unless they're absolutely necessary.

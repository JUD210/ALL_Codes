=== Weaknesses
ㅇ C programs can be error-prone.
- C is a lot like assembly language, where most errors aren't detected until the program is run.
- C contains a number of pitfalls for the unwary.

ㅇ C programs can be difficult to understand.
Although C is a small language by most measures, it has a number of features that aren't found in all programming languages (and that consequently are often misunderstood.)

ㅇ C programs can be difficult to modify.
C lacks features such as classes and packages that support the division of a large program into more manageable pieces.

The integer types and f‌loating types are collectively known as arithmetic types.

--- C89 ---
Here's a summary of the arithmetic types in C89, divided into categories and subcategories:

ㅇ Integral types
- char
- Signed integer types: signed char, short int, int, long int
- Unsigned integer types: unsigned char, unsigned short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int
- Enumerated types

ㅇ Floating types: float, double, long double


--- C99 ---
C99 has a more complicated hierarchy for its arithmetic types:

ㅇ Integer types
- char
- Signed integer types: both standard (signed char, short int, int, long int, long long int) and extended
- Unsigned integer types: both standard (unsigned char, unsigned, short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int, unsigned long long int, _Bool) and extended
- Enumerated types

ㅇ Floating types
- Real floating types: float, double. long double
- Complex types: float _Complex, double _Complex, long double _Complex

=== Integer Constants (+C99)
ㅇ Decimal constants
- Digits between 0 and 9, but must not begin with a zero:
- 15 255 32767

ㅇ Octal constants
- Digits between 0 and 7, and must begin with a zero:
- 017 0377 077777

ㅇ Hexadecimal constants
- Digits between 0 and 9 and letters between a and f, and always begin with 0x:
- 0xf 0xff 0x7fff
- The letters in a hexadecimal constant may be either upper or lower case:
0xff 0xfF 0xFf 0xFF 0Xff 0XfF 0XFf 0XFF


ㅇ Keep in mind that octal and hexadecimal are nothing more than an alternative way of writing numbers; they have no effect on how the numbers are actually stored. (Integers are always stored in binary, regardless of what notation we've
used to express them.)

ㅇ We can switch from one notation to another at any time, and even mix them
: 10 + 015 + 0x20 has the value 55 (decimal).


ㅇ To force the compiler to treat a constant as a long integer, just follow it with the letter L (or l):
15L 0377L 0x7fffL

To indicate that a constant is unsigned, put the letter U (or u) after it:
15U 0377U 0x7ffU

L and U may be used in combination to show that a constant is both long and unsigned:
0xffffffffUL

The order of the L and U doesn't matter, nor does their case.

in C99: LL, ULL is possible.

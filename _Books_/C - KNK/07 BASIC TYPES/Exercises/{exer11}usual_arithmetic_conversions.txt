Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and
d is a variable of type double. What is the type of the expression:
i * f / d?

Order of Evaluation:
(int * float) / double
float / double
double

As double is the largest sized variable used in this operation, the other two
values must be converted to a double so that the operation can be performed.
This means that the expression evaluates to a double value.

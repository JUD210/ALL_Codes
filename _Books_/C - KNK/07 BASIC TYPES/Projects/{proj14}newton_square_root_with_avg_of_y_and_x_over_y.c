/* Write a program that uses Newton's method to compute the square root of a positive floating-point number:

Enter a positive number: 3 (input)
Square root: 1.73205

Let x be the number entered by the user. Newton's method requires an initial guess y for the square root of x (we'll use y = 1).

Successive guesses are found by computing the average of y and x/y. The following table shows how the square root of 3 would be found:

x | y       | x/y     | Average of y and x/y
--|---------|---------|----------------------
3 | 1       | 3       | 2
3 | 2       | 1.5     | 1.75
3 | 1.75    | 1.71429 | 1.73214
3 | 1.73214 | 1.73196 | 1.73205
3 | 1.73205 | 1.73205 | 1.73205

Note that the values of y get progressively closer to the true square root of x. For greater accuracy, your program should use variables of type double rather than float.

Have the program terminate when the absolute value of the difference between the old value of y and the new value of y is less than the product of .00001 and y.

Hint: Call the fabs function to find the absolute value of a double. (You'll need to include the <math.h> header at the beginning of your program in order to use fabs.)

    scanf("%lf", &x);

    do {
        y_old = y;
        y = (y + (x / y)) / 2;
    } while (fabs(y_old - y) >= .00001 * y);

    printf("Square root: %.5lf", y);

    return 0;

=== Reading and Writing Floating-Point Numbers
ㅇ When reading a value of type double, put the letter l in front of e, f, or g:

double d;
scanf("%lf", &d);

Note: Use l only in a scanf format string, not a printf string. In a printf format string, the e, f, and g conversions can be used to write either float or double values. (C99 legalizes the use of %le, %lf, and %lg in calls of printf, although the l has no effect.)


ㅇ When reading or writing a value of type long double, put the letter L in
front of e, f, or g:

long double ld;
scanf("%Lf", &ld);
printf("%Lf", ld);

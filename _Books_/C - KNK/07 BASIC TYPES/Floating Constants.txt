Floating constants can be written in a variety of ways. The following constants, for example, are all valid ways of writing the number 57.0:

57.0
57.
57.0e0
57E0
5.7e1
5.7e+1
.57e2
570.e-1

On occasion, it may be necessary to force the compiler to store a floating constant in float or long double format. To indicate that only single precision is desired, put the letter F (or f) at the end of the constant.
ex) 57.0F or 57.0f

To indicate that a constant should be stored in long double format, put the letter L (or l) at the end.
ex) 57.0L or 57.0l

C99 has a provision for writing fâ€Œloating constants in hexadecimal. Such a constant begins with Ox or OX (like a hexadecimal integer constant). This feature is rarely used.

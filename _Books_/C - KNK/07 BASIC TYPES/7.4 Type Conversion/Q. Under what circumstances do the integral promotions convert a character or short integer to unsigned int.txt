Q: Under what circumstances do the integral promotions convert a character or
short integer to unsigned int?
[p. 143]

A: The integral promotions yield an unsigned int if the int type isn't large enough to include all possible values of the original type. Since characters are usually eight bits long, they are almost always converted to int, which is guaranteed to be at least 16 bits long. Signed short integers can always be converted to int as well.

Unsigned short integers are problematic. lf short integers have the same length as ordinary integers (as they do on a 16-bit machine), then unsigned short integers will have to be converted to unsigned int, since the largest unsigned short integer (65,535 on a 16-bit machine) is larger than the largest int (32,767).

Today's most popular character set is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), a 7-bit code capable of representing 128 characters.

In ASCII, the digits 0 to 9 are represented by the codes 0110000-0111001. and the uppercase letters A to Z are represented by 1000001-1011010. ASCII is often extended to a 256-character code known as Latin-1 that provides the characters necessary for Western European and many African languages.

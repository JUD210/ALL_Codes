ㅇ Decimal constants contain digits between 0 and 9, but must not begin with a zero:
15 255 32767

ㅇ Octal constants contain only digits between 0 and 7, and must begin with a zero:
017 0377 077777

ㅇ Hexadecimal constants contain digits between 0 and 9 and letters between a and f, and always begin with 0x:
Oxf Oxff 0x7fff

The letters in a hexadecimal constant may be either upper or lower case:
Oxff 0xfF 0xFf OxFF OXff OXfF OXFf OXFF


Keep in mind that octal and hexadecimal are nothing more than an alternative way of writing numbers; they have no effect on how the numbers are actually stored. (Integers are always stored in binary, regardless of what notation we've
used to express them.)

We can switch from one notation to another at any time, and even mix them
: 10 + 015 + 0x20 has the value 55 (decimal).

-----------------

To force the compiler to treat a constant as a long integer, just follow it with the letter L (or l):
15L 0377L Ox7fffL

To indicate that a constant is unsigned, put the letter U (or u) after it:
15U 0377U 0x7ffU

L and U may be used in combination to show that a constant is both long and unsigned:
OxffffffffUL

The order of the L and U doesn't matter, nor does their case.

in C99: LL, ULL is possible.

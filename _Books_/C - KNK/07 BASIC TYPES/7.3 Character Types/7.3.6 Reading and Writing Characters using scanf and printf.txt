=== Reading and Writing Characters using scanf and printf
ㅇ The %c conversion specification allows scanf and printf to read and write single characters:

char ch;

scanf("%c", &ch); /* reads a single character */
printf("%c", ch); /* writes a single character */


ㅇ scanf doesn't skip white-space characters before reading a character. If the next unread character is a space, then the variable ch in the previous example will contain a space after scanf returns.

To force scanf to skip white space before reading a character, put a space in its format string just before %c:

scanf(" %c", &ch); /* skips white space, then reads ch */


Recall from Section 3.2 that a blank in a scanf format string means "skip zero or more white-space characters."


ㅇ Since scanf doesn't normally skip white space, it's easy to detect the end of an input line: check to see if the character just read is the new-line character.

For example, the following loop will read and ignore all remaining characters in the current input line:

do {
  scanf("%c", &ch);
} while (ch != '\n');

When scanf is called the next time, it will read the first character on the next input line.

Be careful if you mix getchar and scanf in the same program. scanf has a tendency to leave behind characters that it has "peeked" at but not read, including the new-line character. Consider what happens if we try to read a number first, then a character:

printf("Enter an integer: ");
scanf("%d", &i);
printf("Enter a command: ");
command = getchar();

The call of scanf will leave behind any characters that weren't consumed during the reading of i, including (but not limited to) the new-line character. getchar will fetch the first leftover character, which wasn't what we had in mind.

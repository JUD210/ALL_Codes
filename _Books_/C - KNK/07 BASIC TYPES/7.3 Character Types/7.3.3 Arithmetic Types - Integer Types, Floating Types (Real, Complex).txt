=== Arithmetic Types
ㅇ The integer types and floating types are collectively known as arithmetic types.

ㅇ C89
Here's a summary of the arithmetic types in C89, divided into categories and subcategories:

- Integral types
ㄴ char
ㄴ Signed integer types: signed char, short int, int, long int
ㄴ Unsigned integer types: unsigned char, unsigned short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int
ㄴ Enumerated types

- Floating types: float, double, long double


ㅇ C99
C99 has a more complicated hierarchy for its arithmetic types:

- Integer types
ㄴ char
ㄴ Signed integer types: both standard (signed char, short int, int, long int, long long int) and extended
ㄴ Unsigned integer types: both standard (unsigned char, unsigned, short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int, unsigned long long int, _Bool) and extended
ㄴ Enumerated types

- Floating types
ㄴ Real floating types: float, double, long double
ㄴ Complex types: float _Complex, double _Complex, long double _Complex

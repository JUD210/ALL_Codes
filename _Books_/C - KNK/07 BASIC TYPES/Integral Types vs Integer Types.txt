In light of the close relationship between characters and integers, C89 uses the term integral types to refer to both the integer types and the character types. Enu-
merated types are also integral types.

C99 doesn't use the term "integral types." Instead. it expands the meaning of
"integer types" to include the character types and the enumerated types.

C99's _Bool type is considered to be an unsigned integer type.

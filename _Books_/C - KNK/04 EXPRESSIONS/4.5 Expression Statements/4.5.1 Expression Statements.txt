=== Expression Statements
ㅇ C has the unusual rule that any expression can be used as a statement. That is, any expression --regardless of its type or what it computes-- can be turned into a statement by appending a semicolon.

ㅇ For example, we could turn these expressions into a statement:
++i;
i--;
i * j - 1;  // Since i and j aren't changed, this statement serves no purpose.

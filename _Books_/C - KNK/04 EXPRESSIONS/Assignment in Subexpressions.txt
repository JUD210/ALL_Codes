a = 5;

c = (b = a + 2) - (a = 1);

The effect of executing the second statement is undefâ€Œined; the C standard doesn't say what will happen. With most compilers, the value of c will be either 6 or 2.

Avoid writing expressions that access the value of a variable and also modify the variable elsewhere in the expression.

Be careful when an array subscript has a side effect. For example, the following loop ㅡwhich is supposed to copy the elements of the array b into the array aㅡ may not work properly:

i = 0;
while (i < N)
  a[i] = b[i++];

The expression a[i] = b[i++] accesses the value of i and also modifies i elsewhere in the expression, which ㅡas we saw in Section 4.4ㅡ causes undefined behavior.

Of course, we can easily avoid the problem by removing the increment
from the subscript:
for (i = O; i < N; i++)
  a[i] = b[i];

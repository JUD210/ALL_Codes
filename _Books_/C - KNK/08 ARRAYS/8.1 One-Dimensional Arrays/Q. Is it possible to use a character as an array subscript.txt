Q: Is it possible to use a character as an array subscript?

A: Yes, because C treats characters as integers. You'll probably need to "scale" the character before you use it as a subscript, though. Let's say that we want the letter_count array to keep track of a count for each letter in the alphabet. The array will need 26 elements, so we'd declare it in the following way:

int letter_count[26];

However, we can't use letters to subscript letter_count directly, because their
integer values don't fall between 0 and 25. To scale a lower-case letter to the
proper range, we can simply subtract 'a'; to scale an upper-case letter, we'll subtract 'A'.

For example, if ch contains a lower-case letter, we'd write

letter_count [ch-'a'] = 0;

to clear the count that corresponds to ch. A minor caveat: this technique isn't completely portable, because it assumes that letters have consecutive codes. However, it works with most character sets, including ASCII.

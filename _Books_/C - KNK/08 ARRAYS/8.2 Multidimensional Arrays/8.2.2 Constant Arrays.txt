=== Constant Arrays
ㅇ Any array, whether one-dimensional or multidimensional, can be made "constant" by starting its declaration with the word const:

const char hex_chars[] =
  { '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9',
    'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};

An array that's been declared const should not be modified by the program; the compiler will detect direct attempts to modify an element.


ㅇ Declaring an array to be const has a couple of primary advantages. It documents that the program won't change the array, which can be valuable information for someone reading the code later.

It also helps the compiler catch errors, by informing it that we don't intend to modify the array.


ㅇ const isn't limited to arrays; it works with any variable, as we'll see later. However, const is particularly useful in array declarations, because arrays may contain reference information that won't change during program execution.

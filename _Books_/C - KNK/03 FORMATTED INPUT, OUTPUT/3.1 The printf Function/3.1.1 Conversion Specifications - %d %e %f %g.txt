=== Conversion Specifications
ㅇ %m.pX or %-m.pX
-: left justification
m: minimum field width
.p: precision (this depends on the choice of X!)
X: conversion specifier

ㅇ The most common conversion specifiers:
%d, %e, %f, %g

ㅇ d: integer in decimal form.
- p indicates the minimum number of digits to display
- If p is omitted, it is assumed to have the value 1. (%d == %.1d)

ㅇ e: floating-point number in exponential format (scientific notation).
- p indicates how many digits should appear after the decimal point
- If p is 0, the decimal point is not displayed. (default = 6)

ㅇ f: floating-point number in fixed decimal format, without an exponent.
- p has the same meaning as for the e specifier.

ㅇ g: floating-point number in either exponential format or fixed decimal format, depending on the number's size.
- p indicates the maximum number of significant digits (not digits after the decimal point) to be displayed.
- Unlike the f conversion, the g conversion won't show trailing zeros.
- If the value to be printed has no digits after the decimal point, g doesn't display the decimal point.

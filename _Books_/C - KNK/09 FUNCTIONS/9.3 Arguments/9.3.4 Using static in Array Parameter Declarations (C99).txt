=== Using static in Array Parameter Declarations
ㅇ C99 allows the use of the keyword static in the declaration of array parameters. (The keyword itself existed before C99. Section 18.2 discusses its traditional uses.)

In the following example, putting static in front of the number 3 indicates that the length of a is guaranteed to be at least 3:

int sum_array(int a[static 3], int n)
{
  ...
}

Using static in this way has no effect on the behavior of the program. The presence of static is merely a "hint" that may allow a C compiler to generate faster instructions for accessing the array. (If the compiler knows that an array will always have a certain minimum length, it can arrange to "prefetch" these elements from memory when the function is called, before the elements are actually needed by statements within the function.)


ㅇ One last note about static: If an array parameter has more than one dimension, static can be used only in the first dimension (for example, when specifying the number of rows in a two-dimensional array).

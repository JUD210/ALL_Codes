There are five possible meanings of & (ampersand) in the C programming language, depending on context.

1. If the & appears in a comment, it is meaningless to the language and is ignored.

2. If the & appears inside of a string constant (double quotes) or character constant (single quotes), it is simply the & character.

3. If a single & appears between two expressions of integral types, it is the bitwise AND operator, which performs an and operation between each corresponding bit in the values of the two operands.

4. If the sequence && appears between two expressions, it is the logical AND operator, which results in a zero value if either operand is zero (or false), and a non-zero value if both operands are non-zero (or true). This is one of the C operators that does short-circuit evaluation. In this case, if the left operand is found to be zero (false), the right operand is not evaluated at all.

5. If a single & appears to the left of an identifier, it is the unary address-of operator, which evaluates to the memory address of the operand.

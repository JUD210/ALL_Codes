=== Compiling and Linking
ㅇ Preprocessing
- The program is first given to a preprocessor, which obeys commands that begin with # (known as directives).
- A preprocessor is a bit like an editor; it can add things to the program and make modifications.

ㅇ Compiling
- The modified program now goes to a compiler, which translates it
into machine instructions (object code).
- The program isn't quite ready to run yet, however.

ㅇ Linking
- In the final step, a linker combines the object code produced by the compiler with any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program.
- This additional code inciudes library functions (like printf) that are used in the program.

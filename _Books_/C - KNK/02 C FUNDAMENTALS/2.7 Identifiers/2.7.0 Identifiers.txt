=== Identifiers
ㅇ In computer languages, identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) which name language entities. Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include variables, types, labels, subroutines, and packages.

ㅇ As we're writing a program, we'll have to choose names for variables, functions, macros, and other entities. These names are called identifiers.

ㅇ An identifier may contain letters, digits, and underscores, but must begin with a letter or underscore.

ㅇ In C99, identifiers may contain certain "universal character names" as well.

ㅇ Case sensitive.
job != joB != jOb != jOB != JOB != ...

ㅇ legal identifiers example
- times10
- get_next_char
- _done

ㅇ Not legal identifiers example
- 10times
- get-next-char

ㅇ Good conventions
- symbol_table, current_page, name_and_address (C, Python)
- symbolTable, currentPage, nameAndAddress (Java, C#, C++)

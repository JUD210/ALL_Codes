=== Layout of a C Program
ㅇ We can think of a C program as a series of tokens: groups of characters that can't be split up without changing their meaning.

ㅇ Identifiers and keywords are tokens.

ㅇ So are operators like + and --, punctuation marks such as the comma and semicolon, and string literals.

ㅇ For example, the statement printf("Height: %d\n", height);
consists of seven tokens:

printf ( "Height: %d\n" , height ) ;
  1    2        3       4   5    6 7

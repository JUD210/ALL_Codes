Q: If i is an int variable and f is a float variable, what is the type of the conditional expression (i) > 0 ? i : f) ?

A: When int and float values are mixed in a conditional expression, as they are here, the expression has type float. 

If i > O is true, the value of the expression will be the value of i after conversion to float type.

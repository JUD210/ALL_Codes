/* 
  It is illegal. 
  
  As comparison operations are left associative, n is compared with 1, and then the result is compared with 10.

  n >= 1 yields 0 or 1, and then the 0 <= 10 or 1 <= 10 always yields 1 (true).

  In short, whatever n's value is, as the if's conditional expression always yields 1 (true), printf function would always be called.

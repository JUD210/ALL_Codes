/*
  It is a legal statement.
  (Although it's not gonna work as we expect.)

  First, in the if's expression, 1 - 10 is evaluated to -9.
  Then, (n == -9) is evaluated as 0, meaning the final value is 0.
  Since the value is 0, it skips the printf statement and exits.

  Note: The precedence of equality operators is less than arithmetic operators.

==  != are left associative.

Like the relational operators, the equality operators are left associative and
produce either 0 (false) or 1 (true) as their result. 

However, the equality operators have lower precedence than the relational operators. 

For example, the expression

i < j == j < k

is equivalent to

(i < j) == (j < k)

which is true if i < j and j < k are both true or both false.

Clever programmers sometimes exploit the fact that the relational and equality
operators return integer values. 

For example, the value of the expression (i >= j) + (i == j) is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether i is less than, greater than, or equal to j,respectively. 

Tricky coding like this generally isn't a good idea. however; it makes programs hard to understand.

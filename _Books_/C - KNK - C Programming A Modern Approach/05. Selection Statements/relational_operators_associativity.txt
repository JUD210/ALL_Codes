<  >  <=  >= are left associative.

The expression

i < j < k

is legal in C. but doesn’t have the meaning that you might expect. Since the < operator is left associative, this expression is equivalent to

(i < j) < k

In other words, the expression f‌irst tests whether i is less than j; the 1 or 0 produced by this comparison is then compared to k. The expression does not test whether j lies between i and k. (We’ll see later in this section that the correct expression would be i < j && j < k.)

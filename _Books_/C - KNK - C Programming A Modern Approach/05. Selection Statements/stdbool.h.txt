in C99, there are two options to use boolean.

1. _Bool

In general, attempting to store a nonzero value into a _Bool variable will cause the variable to be assigned 1


2. <stdbool.h> + bool

bool flag;  // same as _Bool flag;

flag = false;  // same as flag = 0
flag = true;  // same as flag = 1

true and false are macros definitions.

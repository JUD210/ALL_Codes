The conditional operator consists of two symbols (? and :), which must be
used together in the following way: 

expr1 ? expr2 : expr3

expr1, expr2, and expr3 can be expressions of any type. The resulting expression is said to be a conditional expression. The conditional operator is unique among C operators in that it requires three operands instead of one or two. 

For this reason, it is often referred to as a ternary operator.

The following example illustrates the conditional operator:

int i, j, k;

i = 1;
j = 2:
k = i > j ? i : j;         /* k is now 2 */
k = (i >= 0 ? i : O) + j;  /* k is now 3 */

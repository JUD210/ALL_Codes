Implicit conversions are performed in the following situations:

- When the operands in an arithmetic or logical expression don’t have the same
type. (C performs what are known as the usual arithmetic conversions.)

- When the type of the expression on the right side of an assignment doesn't
match the type of the variable on the left side.

- When the type of an argument in a function call doesn’t match the type of the
corresponding parameter.

- When the type of the expression in a return statement doesn’t match the
function’s return type.

We’ll discuss the first two cases now and save the others for Chapter 9.

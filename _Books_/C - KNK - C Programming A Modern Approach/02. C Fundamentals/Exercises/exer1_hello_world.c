/* Create and run Kernighan and Ritchie's famous "hello, world" program: */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(/* void */)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
  // hello, world
}

/* Do you get a warning message from the compiler? If so, what's needed to make it go away? 


Add below statement.
return 0;

Btw, there is no warning message even if I don't state return 0!
I guess because it is automatically returning 0 like the book said.

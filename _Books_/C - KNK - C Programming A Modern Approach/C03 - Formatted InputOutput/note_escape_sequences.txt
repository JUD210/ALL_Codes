Escape sequences enable strings to contain characters that would otherwise cause problems for the compiler, including nonprinting (control) characters and characters that have a special meaning to the compiler (such as ").

Here's a sample:

\a: Alert (bell)
\b: Backspace
\n: New line
\t: Horizontal tab

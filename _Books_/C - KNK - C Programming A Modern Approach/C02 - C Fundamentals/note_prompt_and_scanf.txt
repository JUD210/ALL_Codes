int radius;
printf("Enter radius of sphere: ");
scanf("%d", &radius);

A message that asks the user to enter input (a prompt) normally shouldn't end with a new-line character, because we want the user to enter input on the same line as the prompt itself. 

When the user presses the Enter key, the cursor automatically moves to the next line.

If a single & appears to the left of an identifier, it is the unary address-of operator, which evaluates to the memory address of the operand.

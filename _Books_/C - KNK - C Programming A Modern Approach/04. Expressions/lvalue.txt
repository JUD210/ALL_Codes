An lvalue (pronounced “L-value") represents an object stored in computer memory, not a constant or the result of a computation. Variables are lvalues: expressions such as 10 or 2 * i are not. 

At this point, variables are the only lvalues that we know about; other kinds of lvalues will appear in later chapters.

Since the assignment operator requires an lvalue as its left Operand, it’s illegal to put any other kind of expression on the left side of an assignment expression:

12 = i:    /*** WRONG ***/
i + j = 0; /*** WRONG ***/
-i = j;    /*** WRONG aan/

The compiler will detect errors of this nature, and you’ll get an error message such as “invalid lvalue in assignment."

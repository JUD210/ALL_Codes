ㅉe call the list the child and the sequence the parent (or subclass list and superclass sequence). 

This is often referred to as an IS-A Relationship (the list IS-A sequential collection). 

This implies that lists inherit important characteristics from sequences, namely the ordering of the underlying data and operations such as concatenation, repetition, and indexing.

""" Modules, Packages, and Names
In order to manage the code better, modules in the Python Standard Library are split down into sub-modules that are contained within a package. A package is simply a module that contains sub-modules. A sub-module is specified with the usual dot notation.

Modules that are submodules are specified by the package name and then the submodule name separated by a dot. You can import the submodule like this.

import package_name.submodule_name


Sometimes, naming can be a point of confusion when working with modules.

For example, a module might be named after one of the important classes or functions within it like this.

from datetime import datetime

datetime.somemethod()
# refer to the datetime class.
# not refer to the datetime module.

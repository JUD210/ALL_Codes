""" Naming Conventions for Functions
Function names follow the same naming conventions as variables.

1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your function names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.

2. You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python, which you’ll learn about throughout this course. A list of Python reserved words is described here.

3. Try to use descriptive names that can help readers understand what the function does.

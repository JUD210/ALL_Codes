""" Indentation

Some other languages use braces to show where blocks of code begin and end. In Python we use indentation to enclose blocks of code. For example, if statements use indentation to tell Python what code is inside and outside of different clauses.

In Python, indents conventionally come in multiples of four spaces. Be strict about following this convention, because changing the indentation can completely change the meaning of the code. If you are working on a team of Python programmers, it's important that everyone follows the same indentation convention!


    Spaces or Tabs?

The Python Style Guide recommends using 4 spaces to indent, rather than using a tab. Whichever you use, be aware that "Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.

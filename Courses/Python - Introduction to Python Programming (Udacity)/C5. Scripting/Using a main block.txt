""" Using a main block

To avoid running executable statements in a script when it's imported as a module in another script, include these lines in an if __name__ == "__main__" block. Or alternatively, include them in a function called main() and call this in the if main block.

Whenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called __name__ for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, and sets the __name__ variable for this module to the string "__main__". For any modules that are imported in this script, this built-in __name__ variable is just set to the name of that module. Therefore, the condition if __name__ == "__main__"is just checking whether this module is the main program.

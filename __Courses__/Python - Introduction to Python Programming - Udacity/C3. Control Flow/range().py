"""

range() is a built-in function used to create an iterable sequence of numbers. You will frequently use range() with a for loop to repeat an action a certain number of times, as in this example:

"""

for n in range(10):
    print("n={}, 1<=n<=10 is {}".format(n, 5 <= n <= 8))


""" range(start, stop, step)

range(4) returns 0, 1, 2, 3
range(2, 6) returns 2, 3, 4, 5
range(1, 10, 2) returns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

""" Quiz: Guess My Number

You decide you want to play a game where you are hiding a number from someone. Store this number in a variable called 'answer'. Another user provides a number called 'guess'. By comparing guess to answer, you inform the user if their guess is too high or too low.

Fill in the conditionals below to inform the user about how their guess compares to the answer.

"""


answer = 4.45E+8  # provide answer
guess = 9.901E+8  # provide guess

if guess < answer:  # provide conditional
    result = "Oops!  Your guess was too low."
elif guess > answer:  # provide conditional
    result = "Oops!  Your guess was too high."
elif guess == answer:  # provide conditional
    result = "Nice!  Your guess matched the answer!"

print(result)

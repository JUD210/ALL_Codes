NOTE : Regex are usually not the answer due to the fragility of html pages on the internet today -- common mistakes like missing end tags, mismatched tags, forgetting to close an attribute quote, would all derail a perfectly good regular expression.

Instead, you can use libraries like Beautiful Soup or html5lib (both Python) or phpQuery (PHP) which not only parse the HTML but allow you to walk to DOM quickly and easily.

^\<(?:(?:a|div)).*\<\/?(\w+)\>$


It is a best practice to use a proper library to parse html, but to find simple tag names, you can use the expression
<(\w+).

You can also capture tag contents
>([\w\s]*)<

or even attribute values
='([\w://.]*)' if desired (not the goal of this problem though).
